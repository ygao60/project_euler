# project_euler

p083_matrix.txt is the input file for problem 83, which is downloaded from problem 83: https://projecteuler.net/problem=83

77.js, 83.js, 114.js are javascript code.
report_project_euler.pdf is the report.

package-lock.json and the folder node_modules are downloaded when I install xmlhttprequest from https://www.npmjs.com/package/xmlhttprequest for problem 83. I installed xmlhttprequest when I was reading the input file from url https://projecteuler.net/project/resources/p083_matrix.txt. However they don't necessarily be used since I also provide a way to read input data from local file, which is p083_matrix.txt.
